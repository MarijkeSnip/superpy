REPORT
As requested is this my short report on the Superpy project. 
Superpy is a command-line tool to keep track of your inventory.

modules used:

-Pandas
This was a mandatory module to use. At first it was challenging for me to see why i needed this, but i have to admit it was pretty useful once understood.
The creating of dataframes was a quick way of collecting the needed data.

-Tabulate
This was a chosen module to use. It helped to give a better view on displayed dataframes in CLI

-Matplotlib
This was also a chosen module to use. With this module i created a (simple) linechart to display the total revenue per month between given dates.

There are comments added to the used functions in the python files for clarification. And an instruction file (README.md) is added with multiple examples of how to use Superpy.
Hopefully this is enough.
